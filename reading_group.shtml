                        <h3>Previously Discussed Papers</h3>

                        <ul>
                          <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1879">qRAM</a>: Typically we think of quantum computers as applying unitary gates to qubits and then measuring them. However, there are models of quantum computation that utilize adaptive measurements on highly entangled states. These models include teleportation-based quantum computing and one-way quantum computing. Stealth startup PsiQuantum is the one-way model, for example, in their implementation of photonic quantum computers.</li>
                          <li><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/qa/qa.pdf">Quantum Walks</a>: Quantum walks are motivated by the widespread use of classical random walks in the design of randomized algorithms, and are part of several quantum algorithms. For some oracular problems, quantum walks provide an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm. Quantum walks also give polynomial speedups over classical algorithms for many practical problems, such as the element distinctness problem, the triangle finding problem, and evaluating NAND trees. The well-known Grover search algorithm can also be viewed as a quantum walk algorithm.</li>
                          <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.0471">Quantum SVM</a>: Supervised machine learning is the classification of new data based on already classified training examples. In this work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer, with complexity logarithmic in the size of the vectors and the number of training examples. In cases when classical sampling algorithms require polynomial time, an exponential speed-up is obtained. At the core of this quantum big data algorithm is a non-sparse matrix exponentiation technique for efficiently performing a matrix inversion of the training data inner-product (kernel) matrix.</li>
                          <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02625">Low Rank Representations for Quantum Simulation of Electronic Structure</a>: The quantum simulation of quantum chemistry is a promising application of quantum computers. However, for N molecular orbitals, the O(N^4) gate complexity of performing Hamiltonian and unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter steps makes simulation based on such primitives challenging. We substantially reduce the gate complexity of such primitives through a two-step low-rank factorization of the Hamiltonian and cluster operator, accompanied by truncation of small terms. Using truncations that incur errors below chemical accuracy, we are able to perform Trotter steps of the arbitrary basis electronic structure Hamiltonian with O(N^3) gate complexity in small simulations, which reduces to O(N^2 logN) gate complexity in the asymptotic regime, while our unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter step has O(N^3) gate complexity as a function of increasing basis size for a given molecule. In the case of the Hamiltonian Trotter step, these circuits have O(N^2) depth on a linearly connected array, an improvement over the O(N^3) scaling assuming no truncation. As a practical example, we show that a chemically accurate Hamiltonian Trotter step for a 50 qubit molecular simulation can be carried out in the molecular orbital basis with as few as 4,000 layers of parallel nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates, consisting of fewer than 100,000 non-Clifford rotations. We also apply our algorithm to iron-sulfur clusters relevant for elucidating the mode of action of metalloenzymes.</li>
                          <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0566">Quantum LDPC Codes</a>: The current best asymptotic lower bound on the minimum distance of quantum LDPC codes with fixed non-zero rate is logarithmic in the blocklength. We propose a construction of quantum LDPC codes with fixed non-zero rate and prove that the minimum distance grows proportionally to the square root of the blocklength.</li>
                          <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02989">TensorFlow Quantum</a>: We introduce TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ), an open source library for the rapid prototyping of hybrid quantum-classical models for classical or quantum data. This framework offers high-level abstractions for the design and training of both discriminative and generative quantum models under TensorFlow and supports high-performance quantum circuit simulators. We provide an overview of the software architecture and building blocks through several examples and review the theory of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. We illustrate TFQ functionalities via several basic applications including supervised learning for quantum classification, quantum control, and quantum approximate optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can apply TFQ to tackle advanced quantum learning tasks including meta-learning, Hamiltonian learning, and sampling thermal states. We hope this framework provides the necessary tools for the quantum computing and machine learning research communities to explore models of both natural and artificial quantum systems, and ultimately discover new quantum algorithms which could potentially yield a quantum advantage.</li>
